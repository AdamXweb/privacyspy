Hi there,

A new suggestion was posted by {{suggestion.user.username}}. You are receiving this email because you are either a maintainer for the relevant policy, or an admin.

(For your safety, the text below has been escaped. The formatting might look a bit weird.)

Message: {{suggestion.text}}
Policy: {% if suggestion.policy != None %}{{suggestion.policy.product.name}} (policy id {{suggestion.policy.id}}){% else %}No policy specified{% endif %}

You can view the suggestion here: {{base_url}}{% if suggestion.policy != None %}{% url 'edit_policy' suggestion.policy.id %}{% else %}{% url 'suggestions' %}{% endif %}

Best,
PrivacySpy
