                Most people don’t have the patience to read privacy policies. But privacy is important, and we
                shouldn’t just trust that products are treating our data right. PrivacySpy uses a consistent rubric to
                grade privacy policies on a ten-point scale.
            </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Most privacy policies are convoluted&mdash;sometimes even intentionally so. They can be
            difficult to read, and even more difficult to comprehend. Rarely do they provide actionable insight into
            protecting one's data.</p>
        <p>Making matters worse, companies are often only held accountable for their privacy practices when a data
            breach occurs or when they experience fallout from mishandling user data (think Facebook's Cambridge
            Analytica scandal, for example).</p>
        <p>If companies were held accountable for their privacy policies&mdash;not just for creating policies, but also
            for creating <i>good</i> ones&mdash;our data would be safer. And if our data is safer, <a

                is democracy</a>. Because <a href="https://whyprivacymatters.org">privacy matters</a>.</p>
        <h1 id="features" class="title is-size-3">Features</h1>
        <p><strong>PrivacySpy makes privacy policies more convenient and accessible</strong> for those who simply don't
            have the time&mdash;or patience&mdash;to read full privacy policies themselves. Privacy
            policies should be
            more than just a box to check; they are fundamental to ensuring data transparency and allowing users to make
            informed choices. PrivacySpy is trying to make this our reality in three ways:</p>
        <p><strong>Ratings &mdash;</strong> We rate our policies using a consistent and vetted rubric. You can
            understand the key features and
            drawbacks
            of any rated policy at a glance.</p>
        <p><strong>Highlights &mdash;</strong> We use natural language processing to bring your attention to key
            elements of privacy policies. After
            all, reading something is better than reading nothing. (Please note that this is an experimental
            feature accessible at the bottom of each policy page.)</p>
        <p><strong>Warnings &mdash;</strong> When a product or company in our database is found mishandling user data,
            we note it on our
            website. That way, you can contextualize a service's privacy policy with its record.</p>
        <h1 id="definitions" class="title is-size-3">Definitions</h1>
        <p>PrivacySpy uses a number of terms to describe how companies handle personal information. To ensure
            consistency,
            we've defined the key ones below. Note that our rubric, ratings, and defintions not intended to be read as
            legal
            documents.</p>
        <p><strong>Personal data &mdash;</strong> (from the GDPR) "any information relating to an identified or
            identifiable
            natural person
            ('data subject')" <span class="has-text-grey-light">(examples include IP addresses, individual usage
                statistics,
                etc.)</span></p>
        <p><strong>Non-critical purposes &mdash;</strong> any use of personal data beyond what is reasonably necessary
            to
            provide the user a desired core service <span class="has-text-grey-light">(a critical use of personal data
                would be
                using email addresses to send
                password reset emails; a non-critical use of personal data would be using email addresses and browsing
                habits to
                serve behavioral marketing)</span></p>
        <h1 id="ratings" class="title is-size-3">Calculating Ratings</h1>
        <p>A product's overall rating is calculated according to its subratings in all of the rubric questions (see
            below). Higher ratings are better.
            Here are the steps our scoring algorithm takes to calculate the overall score:
        </p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Find the total number of points the policy receives across all rubric questions (subscore sum);</li>
                <li>Find the total number of possible points to receive (maximum score sum);</li>
                <li>Divide the points received by the points possible;</li>
                <li>Multiply by 10 (to fit the score to the final ten-point scale).</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>For example, if there are three total questions with max scores of 5, 10, and 10, the total number of
            possible
            points is 25. If a policy receives scores of 4, 7, and 6 on each of those questions (respectively), it will
            have
            received 17 points. The overall score would be (4 + 7 + 6) / (5 + 10 + 10) = (17 / 25) = 0.68, which, when
            fitted
            to our final ten-point scale, is displayed as 6.8.
        </p>
        <h1 id="rubric" class="title is-size-3">Rubric</h1>
        <p>A key element of PrivacySpy is its ratings, which are calculated based on a consistent rubric. All of our
            scores
            are fully transparent and backed by citations and/or notes.</p>
        <p>We acknowledge that no rubric, no matter how good, can perfectly encapsulate the 'quality' of a privacy
            policy.
            That's why we don't ask you to trust us. We've included our full grading system below so you can evaluate it
            for
            yourself.</p>
        <p>Note that while we do our best to ensure accuracy and consistency in our grading, there are bound to be some
            errors. If you find an error, please correct it using our 'suggestions' functionality (or offer to be a
            maintainer yourself). Thanks for helping us make PrivacySpy even better.</p>
