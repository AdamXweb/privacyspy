# 🔏 PrivacySpy

Most people don’t have the patience to read privacy policies. But privacy is important, and we shouldn’t just trust that products are treating our data right. PrivacySpy uses a consistent rubric to grade privacy policies on a ten-point scale.

## Debugging

If you'd like to run this webserver on your own machine, make sure you set the environment variable `DEBUG` to `True` — otherwise, you might have trouble with Heroku's wrapper.
