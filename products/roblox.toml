If you do not want us to use your phone number to find your friends on Roblox, please adjust your privacy settings on the Service.

  "How do I delete my account?\nWe do not have a feature for players to delete their accounts. If you no longer wish to play on your account, you can just stop. It will remain with us until you're ready to play again.
