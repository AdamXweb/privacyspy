  "All information you provide to us is stored on our secure servers in the Netherlands (Greenhost.net). Sensitive data in our database such as your recipient email addresses are encrypted using OpenSSL and the AES-256-CBC cipher. Furthermore, all encrypted values are signed with a message authentication code (MAC) to detect any modifications to the encrypted string. Two Factor Authentication (2FA) is also available on our site and we encourage users to enable it.\n\nOpportunistic DANE TLS encryption with strong cipher preference is used for all emails sent through our service. Our mail server also utilises STARTTLS, PFS, DNSSEC, MTA-STS, TLS-RPT, DMARC, SPF and DKIM. These measures help to protect emails sent to/from our server against MiTM (Man in The Middle) downgrade attacks and also against the risk of email forgery.\n\nOur site also uses security features such as; HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security), a strict CSP (Content Security Policy), Subresource Integrity, Expect CT and XSS Protection.\n\nNo service can be 100% secure at all times so please do not use this service to forward emails containing highly sensitive information such as bank or cryptocurrency information.\n\nWe take all measures reasonably necessary to protect against unauthorised access, use, alteration or desctruction of data."
