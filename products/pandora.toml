  "We share information we collect with our parent corporation, Sirius XM and its subsidiaries for the purposes described in our respective privacy policies, and to offer, provide, and improve services and products offered both individually and jointly with other Sirius XM companies. Sirius XM's privacy policy is available at www.siriusxm.com/privacy. Additionally, we may share your personal information, with our successor in interest in the event of a corporate reorganization, merger, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets.\n\nPandora may share information we receive or collect in a variety of ways, such as:\n- When you give Pandora permission through an affirmative election (for example, clicking \"yes\" in response to a message such as \"share my email with this advertiser\").\n- When you participate in community and social networking features on the Pandora Service, such as Pandora Community, forums, listener opinions and reviews, or other forms of communication and interaction which you elect to make public or share on public profiles or in other public forums.\n- If we contract or partner with third parties to provide specialized services on our behalf, such as credit card processors, customer support, ad servers or other providers of advertising services, platform technology providers, bulk email processors who send out emails on our behalf, or parties who assist us with sweepstakes management and prize fulfillment. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only as necessary to provide these services to Pandora. They are not authorized to use your personal information for their own, unrelated purposes.\n- Sharing information about the artists, tracks, stations, and playlists you have created or listened to via the Service, or that are associated with your account, if you have elected to share that information publicly. If your Pandora profile is marked as private, your stations may appear in a search, but your profile will not be linked to that station; however, if someone already knows and enters your entire email address into our search system, they will be able to see a list of all the stations created under that email address.\n- If you elect to take advantage of certain features or services provided jointly by Pandora and third parties, we may share certain information about you with those third parties for account authentication and management, and to enable the Service on their platforms. For example, when you elect to use products, services, features, or functionality, such as Google Now or Pandora for Business, provided by third-party partners, such as Google or Mood Media (respectively), you agree that we may provide certain data about you to those partners in order to enable the product, service, feature, or functionality you intend to use. As another example, when you share information through integrated social networking platforms, such as Facebook, you are agreeing to allow the Pandora service to communicate or \"talk\" with the other service in order to make the social features available for your use. These service providers may have their own data collection, use, and sharing practices that may also be applicable to your personal information, and that are not covered by this policy. You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for your use of those third-party service providers and that it is your responsibility to review the terms of use and privacy policies of the third-party service providers and the methods they use for changing the privacy or sharing settings on such services.\n- If you have given permission to a third party for us to share data about you with them. For example, if you participate as a panelist in a survey with an analytics company, you may, as part of your agreement with that company, have authorized that company to receive data from us about you.\n- To measure and analyze Service usage. For example, we use third-party providers such as Nielsen and ScorecardResearch to measure how long and how frequently you are using the Service. Advertising entities may use these providers to measure the effectiveness of their advertising campaigns. When we use these providers, we provide them with information such as device identifier.\n\nWe may share your information in order to (i) protect or defend the legal rights or property of Pandora, or the legal rights of third parties, employees, agents, and contractors (including enforcement of our agreements); (ii) protect the safety and security of Pandora users or members of the public including acting in urgent circumstances; (iii) protect against fraud or to conduct risk management; or (iv) comply with the law, legal process, or legal and government requests.\n\nPandora may share information we gather from devices you use to access the Service with its third-party vendors or service providers, manufacturers or distributors, or advertising entities. We share this information for a variety of purposes such as mobile listening capping, advertising frequency capping, tracking advertising conversion events, estimating the number of unique users, security and fraud detection, debugging problems with the Pandora Service, and for providing you with more relevant advertisements.\n\nPandora may share with third parties, advertisers, and/or business partners deidentified, aggregated, or anonymized information we receive or collect, such as demographic information, location information, information about the computer or device from which you access the Service, or information about your interactions with the Service. We share such information for a variety of reasons, such as to analyze Service usage, improve the Service and your listener experience, improve the serving of advertisements, or for other similar purposes.\n\nThe Pandora Service offers publicly accessible and available profile pages, Pandora Community, community forums (such as artist, song, or advertiser pages), blogs, and pages on social media platforms. You should be aware that any information you provide or post in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. If your profile is public, any information you place in your user profile, including biographical information, the people you are following, and the people whom you allow to follow you, may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of such information from our public forums, contact our User Support team. In some cases, we may not be able to remove your information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why. To find out more about how to make your profile private, please see the section below on Pandora Profile Visibility.\n\nIf your personal information is transferred or shared as described in this policy, we will seek assurances from the recipients of such information (prior to the transfer) that they will safeguard the information in a manner consistent with this policy. We ask recipients of such information to enter into a contractual relationship with us that includes confidentiality and non-disclosure clauses, and provides the same level of commitment to and protections of information as provided in this policy."
